## 📂 Dashboard Walkthrough

### **Tab 1: Executive Overview** 🏢
The 30-second briefing for C-Suite and Board members. Displays:
- **High-level KPIs** (financial loss, resolution time, affected users, country coverage)
- **Year-over-year trends** in attack volume and severity
- **Industry benchmarking** to identify most-targeted sectors
- **Attack type distribution** with cumulative impact analysis

**Business Value:** Enables rapid situational awareness and trend identification for strategic planning.

---

### **Tab 2: Threat & Risk Analysis** ⚠️
Deep-dive into attack patterns and vulnerability exploitation:
- **Attack type breakdown** with financial loss correlation
- **Security vulnerability rankings** (Top 10 most exploited weaknesses)
- **Source attribution** (insider threats vs. external actors)
- **Temporal patterns** in threat evolution over the decade

**Business Value:** Prioritizes security investments based on actual threat data, not vendor hype.

---

### **Tab 3: Financial & Industry Impact** 💰
Follow the money — quantify cyber risk in business terms:
- **Industry-specific loss metrics** with affected user counts
- **Pareto analysis** (80/20 rule) identifying highest-impact sectors
- **Waterfall chart** showing cumulative financial exposure
- **RFM segmentation** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) for risk-based resource allocation

**Business Value:** Translates technical threats into financial risk language CFOs and Boards understand.

---

### **Tab 4: Geospatial Intelligence** 🌍
Map the threat landscape with precision:
- **Global choropleth** heat map showing loss concentration by country
- **Bubble chart** correlating attack frequency with financial severity
- **Regional pattern analysis** for location-based risk assessment
- **Cross-border threat intelligence** for multinational operations

**Business Value:** Supports geographic expansion decisions and regional security budget allocation.

---

### **Tab 5: Defense & Controls** 🛡️
Measure what matters — defense effectiveness and response metrics:
- **Defense mechanism evaluation** (which controls actually work?)
- **Resolution time analysis** by defense type and industry
- **Cost-benefit modeling** for security investments
- **Performance benchmarking** against industry peers

**Business Value:** Optimizes security spending by identifying high-ROI controls and eliminating ineffective measures.

---

### **Tab 6: ML Evaluation & Insights** 🤖
Predictive analytics for proactive risk management:
- **Random Forest classifier** predicting high-risk incidents (top 75th percentile by loss)
- **ROC curve** with AUC score showing model discrimination power
- **Confusion matrix** validating prediction accuracy
- **Feature importance** ranking which factors drive severe incidents
- **Learning curve** demonstrating model reliability across data volumes

**Business Value:** Shifts security posture from reactive to predictive, enabling early intervention.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Module

### **What It Predicts**
The ML model identifies **high-risk cyber incidents** — those likely to result in severe financial damage. The target variable classifies incidents in the **top 75th percentile** of financial losses as "high risk."

### **How It Works**
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier (ensemble learning for robust predictions)
- **Features:** Attack Type, Industry, Vulnerability, Defense Mechanism, Source, Resolution Time
- **Encoding:** Ordinal encoding for categorical variables with semantic ordering
- **Training Split:** 80/20 train-test split with stratified sampling

### **Evaluation Metrics Explained**
- **ROC Curve:** Measures the model's ability to distinguish high-risk from low-risk incidents (higher AUC = better)
- **Confusion Matrix:** Shows prediction accuracy — true positives (correctly flagged risks) vs. false alarms
- **Feature Importance:** Reveals which incident characteristics most strongly predict severe outcomes (e.g., Attack Type = 35% importance)
- **Learning Curve:** Validates that the model improves with more data and isn't overfitting

**Real-World Application:** Feed current incident data into the model to get an early warning of potentially catastrophic breaches.

## 🎯 Business & Security Use Cases

### **For CISOs / Risk Teams**
- Prioritize vulnerability remediation based on exploitation frequency and loss severity
- Benchmark resolution times against industry averages to improve incident response SLAs
- Build data-driven budget cases by quantifying financial exposure by threat vector

### **For Board / C-Suite**
- Demonstrate cybersecurity ROI with clear loss prevention metrics
- Communicate risk in financial terms (millions lost, users affected) rather than technical jargon
- Support M&A due diligence with industry and geographic risk assessments

### **For SOC Teams**
- Identify attack patterns and threat actor TTPs for playbook development
- Optimize alert tuning by focusing on incident types with highest financial impact
- Track defense effectiveness over time to validate security tool investments

### **For Compliance / Audit**
- Generate evidence-based risk reports for regulatory filings (SOX, GDPR, NIS2)
- Document security control effectiveness for audit committees
- Export filtered datasets for forensic analysis and incident post-mortems
